# Raspberry Pi Mirrorless Camera

### A body and lens system for using a Pi Zero and Pi HQ Camera as a proper portable camera.

This Pi MILC offers a couple of primary benefits over a traditional camera as well as some downsides. The primary objective was to design a camera body which is able to accept all lens types, regardless of manufacturer, as long as they are physically controlled and without EXIF data. This means that any lens from any manufacturer should work as long as it is not computer controlled. This body also allows the lens adaptor to be removed and the stock lenses for the Pi HQ to be used in their place. 

The primary downside is the 5.5x crop this sensor has, which increases the focal length drastically. This limitation as well as the physical size of the Pi and low resolution of the display make taking photos a challenge, but good photos will be sharp and of high quality. This camera works exceptionally well with my other Dispolens project.
